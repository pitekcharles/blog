# blog
A daily blog to improve my web development skills

# Use
This is a project I am starting to get practice working on and updating a website of my own daily. It will function as a sort of "blog" where I can log what I have done and what skills I have either improved or what new skills I have learned. I will also update the readme with any technologies that I use.

# Technology

This project uses HTML.
